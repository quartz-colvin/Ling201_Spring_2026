# Welcome to Linguistics!

- **Course goal:** learn about basic concepts in Linguistics: the scientific study of language

--

- Language is something that comes naturally to us as human beings:

  - We acquire our native language(s) as children simply **by interacting** with peers and caregivers
  
  - We use language to socialize, work, communicate, interact – nearly everything we do!
  
  - And we often use language **without being consciously aware** of it

--

- At the same time, language is extremely **complicated**:

  - *Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* takes 1,860 pages to describe English sentence structure, never mind its sound system, meaning, vocabulary, conversational structure, social and regional variation, etc. – and it's *still not complete!*
  
---

# Course goals

- Linguistics tries to make sense of this complicated system, and findings from linguistics have given us a lot of insight into how language (and the human brain!) works – but there's still more to learn.

--

- So in this course, we're going to learn about how to analyze language from a linguistic point of view. 

--

- We'll first learn some basics about **language and linguistics.** Then we'll spend 1-2 weeks on:

--

  - **Morphology** – the study of *word* structure

  - **Syntax** – the study of *sentence* structure

  - **Semantics** – the study of how (*literal*) meaning is derived from words and phrases
  
  - **Pragmatics** – the study of how (*implied*) meaning is derived from language in context
  
  - **Phonetics** – the study of the *physical properties* of speech sounds (or signs)
  
  - **Phonology** – the study of speech sounds (or signs) *as a system*

---

# **Mental grammar**

## The unspoken rules of language

---

# What is language? What is grammar? 

**Discuss with your neighbors.**

- What is language?

- What is grammar?

- How are the two connected?

---

# What is language?

- Language is a *human communication system* we use for communicating ideas and socializing

--

- Language is a *systematic, rule-governed* system

  - Language combines sounds (or signs) into words, and words into sentences to express complex ideas.

--

  - We need rules to understand how to put together ideas into language when speaking and decode language into ideas when listening: **a mental grammar**

--

  - The rules of your mental grammar might not be those rules you learn in school or read in a textbook, but **every speaker has a mental grammar**, even if they're not aware of it, and no matter what language or dialect they speak.

---

# What is linguistics?

- **Linguistics:** the scientific study of language

  - We use the scientific method with experiments and real-life data to develop theories about how language works.

--

  - A primary goal of linguistics is to figure out *what is in people’s mental grammar.*

--

  - For linguists, *grammar includes everything from how sounds are organized into words to how words are organized into sentences to how sentences are organized into conversations*.

--

  - We all learn our native languages as children, and use the rules of our grammar mostly without thinking about it, but it turns out that the grammar of any language is *extremely complex* and even after years of study, there's still a lot we don't know

# **The Wug Test**

# Unconscious rules (The Wug Test)

- Here's a grammatical rule you probably follow without knowing it exists:

--

  - **How do you form plural nouns in English?**

  - Linguist Jean Berko Gleason invented the famous **Wug Test** to study how children acquire grammatical rules.

  - Let’s use the Wug Test to see what we know about English plurals!

# English plural rule

English plurals follow a simple rule that we all figured out when we learned the language, but we probably were never taught it explicitly and most people aren't aware of it as adults.

--

- We know it's a rule because we were all able to apply that rule to new words.

--

**Rules:**

- Does the word end in a sibilant consonant? *(s, z, sh, zh, ch, j)*

  - **add [-əz]**

--

- Does the word end in a voiceless consonant? *(p, t, k, f, etc.)*

  - **add [-s]**

--

- Does the word end in a voiced consonant? *(b, d, g, m, n, l, r, etc.)* 

  - **add [-z]**

# ***A***-**prefixing**

---

# Non-standard rules (*a*-prefixing)

.pull-left[

So far, we've seen that language follows **mental rules** that are **often unconscious** and aren't always what we learn in school.

  - **All varieties of all languages** follow a mental grammar – even if they're not part of the "standard" language (by the way, "standard language" isn't real!).

- Let's see an example with a phenomenon called a-prefixing.

  - This is when the sound a- is placed before an -ing word.

  - *Example:* children's song "A-Hunting We Will Go"

  - This phenomenon is found in many dialects of English, including Appalachian English.

# Non-standard rules (*a*-prefixing)

As English speakers, you probably have intuitions about how this phenomenon works even if you don't use it yourself.

Which of these sentences sounds **natural** or **possible** to you? That is, which ones could you imagine someone saying?

**1.** I know he was a-tellin’ the truth.

**2.** Those a-screamin’ children didn’t bother me.

**3.** He was a-leadin’ his cow to pasture.

**4.** The movie was a-charmin’.

# Non-standard rules (*a*-prefixing)

.pull-left[
- Even though *a*-prefixing is non-standard, it follows rules!

- You can use a-prefixing:

  - Before *-ing* **verbs** but not **adjs** or **nouns**

  - Before a **consonant** but not a vowel

- **Non-standard varieties follow their own rules.**

- **These rules are part of speakers’ mental grammar.**

# Linguistic rules

---

# Linguistic rules

- One goal of linguistics is to *figure out the rules that explain how language works.*

- All varieties of all languages follow systematic rules, and all speakers have these rules as part of their **mental grammar**, aka their **linguistic competence**.

--

- As we’ve seen today:

  - Grammatical rules may be **unconscious**: we largely use them without being aware of it.

  - Even **non-standard varieties** have grammatical rules.

  - **Every speaker** of **every language and variety** has a mental grammar.

---

# Linguistic rules

- Throughout the semester, we'll keep coming back to this idea of a mental grammar.

--

- We'll learn ways to figure out how grammar works at every level:

--

  - Sounds

--

  - Words

--

  - Sentences

--

  - Conversations

--

- But remember! When we say grammar, **we're talking about what people** ***really do***, and not necessarily what they're "supposed" to do according to textbooks or English class.

# **Descriptivism vs. prescriptivism**

---

# **Descriptivism vs. prescriptivism**

- Consider the following sentence:

  - *I ain't got no time.*

--

- We all understand this sentence, and we may even say sentences like this sometimes.

  - That means it must be part of our mental grammar.

--

- **But** we often hear that sentences like this are "bad English" or "don't have grammar".

  - This sentence in particular uses a double negative and the word *ain't*, which some people look down on.
  
--

- So how can the sentence both be part of our grammar and "not have grammar" at the same time?

  - To understand this, we need to understand the difference between **Prescriptivism and Descriptivism**

---

# **Prescriptivism**

- **Prescriptivism** is an approach to language that asserts that there is only one "correct" way to talk, and that tries to tell people what they should and shouldn't do (it prescribes language).

--

- We often hear prescriptive rules in language classes, writing manuals, style guides, online grammar correction sites. These are rules like:

--

  - Don't use double negatives.

  - Don't split your infinitives.

  - Ain't ain't a word. **(lol)**

  - Don't end sentences with a preposition.
  
--
  
- But English speakers break these rules all the time, and it sounds completely natural to native speakers.

---

# Descriptivism

- An alternative approach is **descriptivism**: an approach to language that seeks to *describe how people really talk* in their daily lives without judgment.

--

- Linguists take a descriptive approach and in this class we'll also take a descriptive approach.

--

- This is important for several reasons:

  - **Linguistics is a science** and descriptivism helps maintain a *neutral, scientific point of view.*

  - If our goal is to understand people's mental grammars, we won't get very far by focusing on prescriptive rules.

  - It **respects** the language patterns of every individual and community as completely legitimate and valid ways to talk.

---

class: center, middle

# Standard vs. non-standard 

---

# Standard vs. non-standard language

- In order to avoid prescriptivism, we need to avoid judgmental terms like "bad grammar", "incorrect language", or "broken English'.

--

- Instead, we'll use the terms **standard and non-standard** to describe language:

  - **Standard language:** the variety taught in schools and used in formal and official settings like the workplace, education, government, newsmedia, textbooks, etc.

--

  - **Non-standard language:** other varieties used in more colloquial settings

--

- **Note:**

  - The standard variety is often a bit artificial and no one speaks that way all the time.

  - People may disagree on what counts as standard or non-standard.

  - Non-standard language may be stigmatized in some cases, but it is just as legitimate and expressive as standard language. There is nothing inherently "better" or "worse" about any variety or language.

---

class: center, middle

# Grammatical vs. ungrammatical

---

# Grammatical vs. ungrammatical

We also need to use the terms grammatical and ungrammatical as linguists understand them.

--

- **Grammatical:** Language that would be said and understood by a native speaker, and would sound natural to a native speaker of the language.

--

- **Ungrammatical:** Language that would not be said or understood by a native speaker. Often, this is language that just doesn't sound right, for example:

  - **John has finishing his homework.* (* = ungrammatical)
  
  - *This apples is delicious.

--

Speakers may disagree on what is grammatical based on their own mental grammar, and **language can be non-standard but still grammatical**, as long as it's something that would sound natural to a native speaker.

- *How about them apples!* and *I don't want none* are both **non-standard but grammatical.**

---

class: center, middle

# Practice

---

# Standard/Non-standard and Grammatical/Ungrammatical

In groups, invent **at least three** English sentences:

  **1.** A grammatical, standard English sentence.

  **2.** A grammatical, non-standard English sentence.

  **3.** An ungrammatical English sentence.

**Pick one** of your group’s sentences to read aloud for the rest of the class. 

The rest of the class will have to figure out which one it is.

# Variation 

---

# Variable rules

So far we've seen that:

- **Language follows rules of a mental grammar**, much of it below the level of awareness

--

- "Grammatical" and "ungrammatical" refer to whether something is in one's mental grammar

--

- Speakers of non-standard varieties also have rules and a mental grammar

--

Another important point: **the rules of language are often variable**

- Not everyone speaks the same, and not everyone has the same mental rules.

--

- Grammar often varies by region, community, and other social factors –but no matter where you're from, you still have a mental grammar!

- This also means that what you consider grammatical/ungrammatical can vary based on what region/community you're from.

# Linguistics is a science

**Linguistics is the scientific study of language**

- When I say language here, I mean the human, cognitive ability to communicate through sounds/signs, not a specific language like English, Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic, etc….

--

One of the goals of linguistics is to understand speakers' mental grammars

**But what does it mean to say that it's a science? What is a science?**

---

# Linguistics as a science

Science uses the **scientific method** to test hypotheses about how natural phenomena (in our case, language) work:

1. Develop a **hypothesis** grounded in personal observations, theory, and previous research.

--

2. **Design an experiment** to collect real-world (empirical) data to test your hypothesis.

--

3. Run your experiment, **collect your data**.

--

4. **Analyze** your data – is your hypothesis true or false?

--

5. Based on your results, **update your theories**, develop a new hypothesis, and **repeat**!
