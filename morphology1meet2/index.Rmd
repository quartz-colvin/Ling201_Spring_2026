# Morphological analysis


**Morphological analysis is a technique for figuring out how the morphology of a language works**

- You can use it to learn how the morphology of an unfamiliar language works, as long as you have a set of words with different morphemes and their translations (*glosses*) into English

--

**Steps:**

1. Identify any repeated sequences of sounds in the dataset - these may be morphemes!

2. Identify any repeated meanings in the English glosses

3. Try to match each meaning from **Step 2** with a potential morpheme from **Step 1**

# Morphological analysis 

## **Steps**

1. Identify any repeated sequences of sounds in the dataset - these may be morphemes!

2. Identify any repeated meanings in the English glosses

3. Try to match each meaning from **Step 2** with a potential morpheme from **Step 1**

  - Try to find two words that differ by just one meaning or morpheme 
  
  - As you work through this, look out for potential homophones or allomorphs
  
  - Don't be afraid to revise your hypotheses if the data suggests you're on the wrong track!

# Practice

## Dataset 1: Isthmus Zapotec (Oto-Manguean, Mexico)

```{r, out.width="120%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/zapotec_dataset.png")
```

- What morphemes does Isthmus Zapotec use to indicate the following concepts?
  
  - stick, dough, tortilla, chicken, rope 
  
  - third person singular (she, he, it)
  
  - second person plural (plural 'you', y'all)
  
  - possession ('s)
  
- The word for four is *tapa*. How would you say "his four" and "your four"?

## Dataset 2

```{r, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/luiseno_dataset.jpg")
```
