# This week...

- So far we've learned what a morpheme is.

- And we've learned about different types of morphemes:

  - root vs. affix, free vs. bound, inflectional vs. derivational

- Today we're going to learn how to put morphemes together to make new words:

  - Morphological Processes

- But first, I want to clarify a points that can be tricky when breaking down words.

---

# Tricky morphemes

Consider the word *break-able*. Which description best fits this word?

- A compound word with two roots: *break + able*

- A simple word with the root break and the suffix -able

We know able is a separate word. But do the word *able* and *-able* mean the same thing? Let's put them in sentences so we can use our intuitions.

- *Freda studies karate. She is able to break the board.*

- *The board is breakable.*

The meanings are related, but subtly different.

- If the meanings are different, they're different morphemes.

- So we consider them different morphemes: free root (word) *able*, bound suffix *-able*

---

# Tricky morphemes

We have a similar situation with morphemes like *-less* or *-ful*

What does the morpheme in bold mean in each sentence?

- *The bucket is* **full** *of water.*

- *A bucket*-**ful** *of water will put out the campfire.*

- *Yuri cared* **less** *than Josephine.*

-  *Yuri was care*-**less** *and made a mistake.*

--

Again, the meanings are related, but subtly different, so we consider them different morphemes:

- *able, full,* and *less* are free roots, *-able, -ful,* and *-less* are bound derivational suffixes

- If you're stuck on a morpheme, try using it in a sentence – it may clear things up

---

# Affixation

Let's move on to morphological processes. The first two should be familiar.

- Affixation: Adding an affix: a prefix, suffix, infix, or circumfix.

  - Depending on the type of affix, also called prefixation, suffixation, infixation, circumfixation.

  - **Prefixation:** *re- + visit → revisit

  - **Suffixation:** *modern + -ize → modernize

  - **Infixation:** Tagalog *bili* 'buy' → *b-um-ili* 'to buy'

  - **Circumfixation:** Indonesian *ajar* 'teach' → *pel-ajar-an* 'subject'

---

# Compounding 

Combining two or more roots into a single word

- *tree + house → treehouse*

- *blue + bird → bluebird*

- *health + care → healthcare*

--

Compound words often sound different from the words used
separately – one of the roots will be pronounced with less stress
than if it had been a separate word:

- Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin – a **tree** house.

- The child played in a **treehouse**.

---

# Compounding

Different languages have different rules for compounding.

Germanic languages are well-known for permitting lots of compounding:

--

- German: *Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän*

- Roots: *Donau- dampf- schiff- fahrts- gesellschafts- kapitän*

- Meaning: Danube- steam- ship- travel- company- captain

  'captain of the Danube Steamship Company'

---

# Compounding

English is also a Germanic language and allows this kind of compounding.

We just write these compounds with spaces:

- Amazon product title: *Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker*

--

It can be confusing what's a string of words and what's a compound with spaces, but:

- Remember that in a compound, typically not all roots are equally stressed.

  - *My cousin sells* **réal estate**. *Graceland is a* **réal estáte**!

- The meaning of compounds is sometimes non-compositional: not derived from the words.

- If it's a long string of nouns, it's probably a compound.

- In the end, spaces are a spelling convention – we don't actually pronounce them.

# Identifying word-formation processes

- Identify the morphological processes involved in the following words. 

- Some will exhibit one process, some will exhibit multiple. 

*(Note: Say the words out loud to hear differences in sound.)*

***word pairs and answers are on the next slide!***

# Identifying word-formation processes

1. feed → fed

2. leaf →  leaves

3. peace →  peaceful

4. foot, ball → football 

5. good →  best

6. chair, woman →  chairwomen

7. back, pack →  backpacks

8. like →  like-liked

9. go →  underwent

# Order of affixation 

- consider the words *unbelievable* and *renewable*. 

  - How many morphemes do they each have? 
  
  - What's the root? Are there prefixes or suffixes? 

--

- Now imagine you start with the root and then add affixes until you get the full word. Do you start with the prefix or suffix? Which do you add first?

  - Is it *un* + *believable* **or** *unbelieve* + *able*? Why? 
  
  - Is it *renew* + *able* **or** *re* + *newable*? Why?

---

# Order of affixation 

- Even though *unbelievable* and *renewable* both have three morphemes (prefix-root-suffix), there seems to be something different about the order in which the morphemes are added to the root!

--

In *un*-**believ**-*able* you add the suffix first and the prefix second
  
--

  1. Does adding an affix make a real word? **believ**-*able* is a real word, but \**un*-**believe** is not
    
    - What does the word mean? *unbelievable* means *not believable*, not *able to be unbelieved* 

--

In *re*-**new**-*able*, you add the suffix first and the prefix second

--

   1. Does adding an affix make a real word? *re*-**new** is a real word, but \***new**-*able* is not
  
  - What does the word mean? *renewable* means *able to be renewed*, not *newable again*

---

# Order of affixation 

This suggest that the **order of affixation**- the order in which you add affixes to a root- plays a role in the morphology of a word!

--

- different words have different orders of affixation 

- order of affixation is part of our mental grammar (what we know about a word as speakers)

--

- we can test a word's order of affixation by:

  - adding an affix and seeing if it makes a real word

--

  - trying to understand what the word means. if your definition involves some smaller combination of the root and an affix, it suggests that the affix is added first 

--

***neither of these tests works 100% of the time, so you should try a combination of them!***

## Hierarchical structure

- order of affixation is somehow connected to the *meaning* of a word

- the fact that we can't add affixes in any order suggests that words have a **hierarchical structure**

--

- we can visualize this structure with a **tree diagram**!

---

# Hierarchical structure

We can visualize this structue with a tree diagram...

- we **start at the bottom** with the root and **build upward**, adding affixes until we get to the full word at the top

--

- an alternative notation is **labeled bracketing**, which is more compact but perhaps less intuitive

--

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> un [<sub>V</sub> [<sub>V</sub> believe ] able ]]

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> [<sub>V</sub> re [<sub>Adj</sub> new ]] able ]

# Trees!

# Trees 

**How to draw a morphological tree:**

1. identify the word's morphemes and write them out separately in one row *(leave plenty of space above them!)*

--

2. identify the root(s) and label their part of speech

--

3. look at the morphemes immediately before and after the root. Which one is added first? Draw lines upward connecting them, and label the new word's part of speech

--

4. this new word becomes the base you'll keep building off of. Repeat step 3 using this new base instead of the root, and continue until you have no unconnected morphemes left

.pull-left[
1. identify morphemes 

  - write them in a row

2. identify root(s) 
  
  - label parts of speech

3. morphemes immediately beside the root: 

  - Which one is added first? 
    
    - Draw lines upward connecting them
    
    - label new word's part of speech

***Reminders:***

- start at the root and move outward/upward

- remember to mark the part of speech at every step/node

- of adding an affix makes something that isn't a word, try adding a different affix instead

- if adding an affix makes something that seems unrelated to the overall word's meaning, try adding a different affix instead

# Undoable

- Consider the word *undoable*. What does it mean? 

- Does it mean something different if it's *undo* + *able* vs. *un* + *doable*? How would you define each word?

# Morphological ambiguity 

---

# Morphological ambiguity 

- this word (***undoable***) is an example of a word with an ambiguous structure 

--

- **structural ambiguity:** depending on the structure you assign it, it has a different meaning 

--

- this suggests that tree drawing isn't just a game: the **meaning** of words is directly affected by their morphological structure!

--

- without knowing the structure, we wouldn't know how to put together the meanings of a word's different morphemes to create the full word

# Practice: ambiguous structures

## Are the following words ambiguous? 

**If yes,** provide labeled bracketings for both readings and explain what each reading means. 

**If no,** explain why not.
